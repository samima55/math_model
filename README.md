Objective: Dimensional Analysis in Fluid Mechanics

Problem Statement:
You are investigating the factors affecting the velocity of water flowing through a pipe. You suspect that the velocity depends on the diameter of the pipe (D), the density of the water (ρ), and the viscosity of the water (μ). Develop a mathematical model for the velocity (v) in terms of these parameters using dimensional analysis.


## Identify Relevant Variables:
Velocity of water (v)
Diameter of the pipe (D)
Density of water (ρ)
Viscosity of water (μ)


## Form Hypothesized Equation:
Start by hypothesizing that the velocity (v) is related to the diameter (D), density (ρ), and viscosity (μ) by some power-law relationship:
v=k⋅D^a⋅ρ^ b⋅μ ^c
where k is a dimensionless constant, and a, b, and c are the unknown exponents.

## Determine Dimensions:
Identify the dimensions of each variable:
[v] = [L]/[T] (velocity)
[D] = [L] (length)
[ρ] = [M]/[L]^3 (mass per unit volume)
[μ] = [M]/[L]/[T] (dynamic viscosity)

## Set Up Dimensional Equations:
Express the dimensions of velocity, diameter, density, and viscosity in terms of the base dimensions (e.g., [M], [L], [T]).
[v]=[L]/[T]
[D]=[L]
[ρ]=[M]/[L]^3
[μ]=[M]/[L]/[T]


## Write Dimensional Equations:
Equate the dimensions in the hypothesized equation:
[L]/[T]=k⋅[L]^ a ⋅([M]/[L] ^3 )^ b ⋅([M]/[L]/[T]) ^c

Solve for the exponents a, b, and c. The exponents must be chosen such that both sides of the equation have the same dimensions.
## Final Equation:
Once you have determined the exponents, the final dimensional analysis equation is:
v=k⋅D^ a ⋅ρ ^b ⋅μ ^c
